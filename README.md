This repository contains the analysis and findings from my Final Year Project (FYP) on Flood Frequency Analysis using L-moments for selected stations in Peninsular Malaysia. The study applies statistical modeling to estimate extreme flood events, using distributions such as Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Generalized Pareto (GPA), and Generalized Logistic (GLO).

Contents:
* R scripts for flood frequency analysis
* Data preprocessing & visualization files
* L-moment ratio calculations
* Model comparison & evaluation results
* Final report & documentation
